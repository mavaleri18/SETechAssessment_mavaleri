Cluster Creation with eksctl

In this project, I opted to create a cluster using eksctl, a user-friendly and efficient tool. eksctl simplifies the cluster creation process by leveraging IaC (Infrastructure as Code) CloudFormation. With just a single command, I was able to create a fully functioning cluster, complete with two active nodes specifically for this assessment.
Requirements

Before proceeding with the cluster creation, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

    IAM User: You should have an IAM User with the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services.
    AWS CLI: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your machine.
    AWS Access Key and Secret Key: Obtain the access key ID and secret access key associated with your IAM User.
    eksctl Installation: Install eksctl, which serves as the primary tool for managing EKS clusters.
    kubectl Installation: Install kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool, to interact with the cluster.
